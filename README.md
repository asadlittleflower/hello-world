# hello-world
just another hello to the world
There's not much about me so it will be short.
I am asadlittleflower! 
I am a beginner programmer and 
I am currently taking a online video game design course.
I personally like to draw and read (specially fanfiction!),
anime/manga among other small things.
I hope to get along with this new community!
